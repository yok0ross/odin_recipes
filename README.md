This is the first project on The Odin Project. My chosen pathway is Java. Ultimately I will endeavour to use the skills gained to build a compiler for the Hack language.

The aim of this project is to create a website contines recipes
This should contain and index page with links to sepaarte pages for the individual recipes.
